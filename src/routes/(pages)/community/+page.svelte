			<h2 id="whatAreTorrents">What Are Torrents</h2>

			<p>
				A <strong>torrent</strong> is a small file that contains metadata about the files and folders
				to be shared and information about the network of computers that share these files. It's used
				with BitTorrent protocol, which enables fast and efficient distribution of large files over the
				internet by allowing users to connect directly to each other to download and upload portions
				of the file simultaneously. This decentralized method of sharing files reduces the load on any
				single server and can lead to faster download speeds for the users involved. Torrents themselves
				do not contain the actual content being shared, only the information needed to find and download
				the content from peers in the BitTorrent network.
			</p>
			<h2 id="whatIsTracker">What Is a Tracker</h2>

			<p>
				A <strong>BitTorrent tracker</strong> is a server that facilitates communication between peers
				using the BitTorrent protocol. When you open a torrent file with a BitTorrent client, the tracker
				is contacted to help find other users who are sharing the same files. It does not store or distribute
				the content itself but keeps track of the IP addresses of the peers in the swarm (the group of
				computers involved in sharing a particular file). The tracker responds to requests from clients
				with a list of peers, allowing them to connect directly to each other to start downloading and
				uploading pieces of the file. Essentially, the tracker acts as a central hub that enables peers
				to find each other, significantly improving the efficiency and speed of file distribution.
			</p>
			<h2 id="whatIsTorrentIndex">What Is a Torrent Index</h2>

			<p>
				A <strong>BitTorrent index</strong> site is a website that lists torrent files for download.
				These sites serve as search engines or directories for finding specific files or content within
				the BitTorrent network. Users can search for and download torrent files based on various categories
				such as movies, music, software, games, and more. Each torrent file listed on an index site contains
				metadata about the content it represents, such as the file name, size, and the address of the
				tracker managing the distribution of the content.
			</p>
			<p>
				BitTorrent index sites do not host the content files themselves; instead, they provide the
				torrent files which users can then open with their BitTorrent clients to download the actual
				content from other peers in the network. These sites play a crucial role in the BitTorrent
				ecosystem by making it easier for users to find and access content distributed via
				BitTorrent.
